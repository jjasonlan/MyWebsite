<h3> Basketball in Nanjing </h3>
<p> After work I ate dinner with ZhangRu near the restuarant where we had the group dinner. It seems that that is a major dining location since every dinner I have eaten in Nanjing as been in the same area. She treated me for a dish of stir fried beef noodles and I felt a bit guilty since I haven't paid for my own dinner even once since I have been in Nanjing this week. While I was eating, I got a call from Cheng Long's friend named Xia who asked where a good spot to pick me up is. Since he couldn't understand the address I sent him, we planned to meet back at Cheng Long's house, since that was the only other location I knew. I had to eat quickly and get there. He picked me up on an electric bike, which is a very popular method of transportation in China, but the backseat was a bit small so I had to cling to the seat. Apparently he usually takes the freeway to get to the basketball court, but he had to take a longer route on surface streets for my safety.</p>
<p> When we parked and got off, I saw a couple small shops but nothing resembling a gym. We bought some water in one of the shops, then I followed him into the dark alley next to the shop and saw a stairway that was unlit and went up probably three stories. I followed him up the creepy stairs and we arrived at a relatively nice basketball court. The floor was wooden and the single full court was full sized. The rims and nets were beat up but still straight. At first I watched the other teams play with a flat ball, but by the time I was up to play they switched to a better ball. The ball felt heavier than what I am accustomed to, but that could be because I haven't played in a while. We played four-on-four in the halfcourt since someone else rented the other half. Typically in China everyone plays half court with rotations so the courts are being used at all times with the maximum amount of people able to participate. Rather than pickup games, they have to organize teams in advance since it costs money to rent the court.</p>
<p> I was on a team with brother Xia and his very tall friend and one other person. His friend was relatively better at basketball than the rest of the players there, and didn't play too hard to let the other teams have a chance. He was also the money collector for the court payment, and rather than rotating out after he lost, he played on every team. Our team won the first two games we played in, and then proceeded the lose the next four or five. Turns out brother Xia wasn't actually a basketball coach. I misunderstood Cheng Long or maybe he was joking because brother Xia was one of the less skilled players on the court. There were a couple good shooters and a lot of mid range shots, but no one really drove in, which is much different than an American pickup game. The other players were all on good terms with each other, so there was a lot of joking and playful shoving which further discouraged short range shot selection, since every time someone got close the the basket they were grabbed or pushed. I wanted to win a few more games since the winner stays on, but we fell short each time. Maybe next week I'll have a better chance. Basketball was fun and left me somewhat sore and stiff. I have been getting a lot of exercise through walking but basketball is more tiring.</p>
<h3> Road to work</h3>
<p> Since I was sore from basketball, I didn't wake up until my alarm went off, and even then I slept for another twenty minutes. By the time I was up, Cheng Long was already getting ready, which was a surprise. He didn't park his car in the lot yesterday, since he took his electric bike to the apartment. The back seat of his bike was even smaller than that of brother Xia's bike, which was pretty awful for me. I clenched the seat so not to fall off and cringed every time there was a bump in the road. He dropped me off at the usual spot near KFC and I walked to work, arriving around 9:15 which is early for me. Work should be more relaxing since I am not doing the translating stuff anymore. With week one coming to an end, I have learned a lot of programming skills and life skills. These experiences in Nanjing are definately helping me grow as a person.</p>

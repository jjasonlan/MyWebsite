<h1> Fourth Entry Part 2</h1>

<h3> Swimming through people</h3>
<p> After work Cheng Long picked me up to go swimming. He swims twice a week, once with his friend and once with his kid. His kid is almost 3 years old, so he doesn't get much exercise when taking care of the kid. I had to buy a swimming cap and swim trunks, and the swim shop was closed so I couldn't even get goggles. The swim lockers in China are no privacy zones, with lockers right next to each other and no dividers between showers. I could adapt to the environment because I had been to a swimming pool in China before, but I can imagine that an American would feel very out of place in a similar situation. Swimming was good exercise but not very comfortable. When we finished changing, the swimming pool was completely full of people. It wasn't possible to swim in a straight line without bumping into people and it was even more difficult for me because I needed to keep my head above water to see since I didn't have swimming goggles. The water in the swimming pool is uncomfortably warm, even though it felt cold when I first entered. The water irritated my eyes when I had to see around me and try to swim normally. Since I am still suffering from the aftereffects of a cold, I couldn't breathe as well which was annoying when I tried to change breaths between strokes. Cheng Long's friend is a basketball coach, and has a very solid body. He trains tougher players and plays basketball with Cheng Long. Today, I am going to play basketball with them after work. I am looking forward to showing off what an American high school varsity caliber player can do. </p>
<h3> Game 3 of NBA Finals</h3>
<p> I am completely shocked that the Warriors keep falling short against the Cavaliers. Both teams aren't playing at their best -- the Cavaliers because of injuries to their star players, and the Warriors because of their uncharacteristically low shooting percentage and high amount of turnovers. At first, I enjoyed watching when David Lee of the Warriors was given playing time, and was very excited when he helped to bridge the Warriors deficit with his passing and offensive prescence, but I was later disappointed by his defensive helplessness. I still hope that Kerr will put Lee in when the Warriors are in a dry spell so that he can get the team going with some smart passes and low post pressure. The Warriors do best in high scoring games, so I feel that it is necessary to sometimes sacrifice defense for offense. Curry was the biggest factor that game, scoring only three points in the entire first half and only a couple points in the third quarter. He finally started making his classic unreal shots in the fourth but it was too little, too late. Delanova was delightful to watch, as he worked on defense to shut down Curry and filled his role spectacularly as Irving's replacement.</p>
<h3> Thursday Morning</h3>
<p> I waited for Cheng Long to wake up this morning, and I thought I would be on time when we left at 8:50. However, he had to go in a different direction so he dropped me off near KFC and I had to walk the rest of the way, so I ended up arriving around my usual time. At work I continued finding errors and thinking of suggestions. I began ignoring some of the most minor errors because they were too insignificant and I had to find the major errors first. Honestly, if they but the text on their website through a basic spelling and grammar checker like Microsoft Word, they would be able to find a lot of issues with the text. Still, my editing campaign was my largest company contribution so far. I was actually quite surprised at how quickly my edits were accepted and added in. The first document of edits that I sent in had already been adopted into the website when I checked in the morning. I should've been impressed by their flexibilty and speed but instead I was more aghast that there most likely wasn't a single fluent English speaker in the entire company who checked my work. On the other hand, I suddenly felt quite empowered making major edits to a website that has been running for years on choppy English.</p>
<h3> More learning</h3>
<p> I actually enjoy learning new things at work, even though I hate learning in school. In the office I have the freedom to learn what I want, at my own quick pace. Of course, I am skimming over things and not fully understanding everything, but there's always something new for me to look into and try to understand. Today, ZhangRu asked for my help translating a couple passages and I got to see what kind of work she was doing. She told me to look into HTML5 Video, which she was also studying at the time to prepare a video that can be played on multiple types of devices. My translating skills pretty much suck, but she knows enough English to understand me most of the time since computer languages require some English knowledge. It turns out that a lot of information on computer science is only in English so even Chinese programmers have to either read the English or find a way to translate it without losing meaning. Currently I am looking into Bootstrap and I have set Photoshop aside. I still need to better understand the use of XAMPP and my basic programming skills (HTML, CSS, JS) need refining. I actually like having interesting things to do throughout the whole day so I feel exhausted at the end of the day rather than tired right from the start. </p>

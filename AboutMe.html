<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Jason Lan, Age 17</h2>
<p> I was born in Los Angeles, California, and have lived there my whole life. I enjoy traveling and playing basketball, as well as using computers and new technology. I am currently a student at North Hollywood High School, entering 12th grade this coming schoolyear. I am currently interested in majoring in computer science, since it is a field that is in high demand, and requires the ability to quickly adapt and learn new things, an ability that I possess. </p>
<p> I am internning in Nanjing, China, and homestaying with a company board member's family. This is my 5th time to China, and my 1st time without staying with family members. This is also my first internship, with a company whose name I didn't even know before my first day of work. I am trying to see if a career in computer science is fit for me, and learn some on-the-job skills for future use. Simultaneously I am trying to add to my college resume, since the three week internship has provided me with countless fresh experiences I can write about. </p>

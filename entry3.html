<h1> Third Entry</h1>
<h2> Jason Lan, June 9. 16:00.</h2>
<h3> Lunch</h3>
<p> Today I went to lunch alone with my boss. The rest of the group employees brought their own food so only we went to eat at the restuarant. I learn a lot about Chinese people and culture during lunch because that is where everyone talks and relaxes, distanced from the silent intensity of the office. I plan to spend the time after lunch to explore Nanjing, but I did not know where to go. I will plot my destination points tonight so I will be able to travel myself tomorrow.</p>
<h3> Back to Work</h3>
<p> I stayed awake again while everyone else slept during the lunch break, but I soon regretted it. I felt pretty tired around 2 o'clock and couldn't really focus on learning. I napped for a short while before returning to my training. I felt pretty refreshed after my nap, so I understand why the other workers sleep during their break. Today is a much warmer day than yesterday, which contributed to my sleepiness. I have yet to do anything of importance as an intern, but I feel like I am learning things that I wouldn't have time to during school. Programming is much more practical than most of the concepts I am learning in school, so I feel more motivated and excited to learn. Of course, the programming I learn in three weeks won't be comprable to the working experience of the other programmers, so I need to look for some way to be useful while continuing to learn these skills. MaoMao's husband explained it in a very logical way: it is too early for me to be learning work-level programming skills since I am going to college to essentially relearn everything I have learned before, so what I want to achieve during my internship is to learn working skills and people skills. Even the Chinese I am constantly learning is of great future importance. The office environment isn't what I had imagined in the sense that there isn't too much pressure on the workers, but I feel like I am an observer rather than experiencing the role of a worker myself.</p>
<h3> Looking at the Bigger Picture </h3>
<p> I know that there is a lot for me to learn in terms of programming, but I pretty much understand the basics now. My past experience in Python is actually helping me understand some of Javascript faster, so I don't need to be so precise in my studying. I feel that learning programming from the online website will only take me so far, and that I will soon need some other method to practice what I have learned. I can incorporate my new skills into my website, but that would make it pretty messy. I will consider making more practice websites to hone my skills. I am hoping that I will have an opportunity to learn something besides programming soon, because I want to be useful while I am interning. My greatest asset is my fluency in English, so I can contribute by correcting language errors on their website. I plan to talk to XuHao about working in support since their support chat is in English, and very poor English at that. I feel like I can make a greater contribution in that area, since I will be working off skills I have that the other workers do not have. The group I am currently in does not need my help, and I cannot make any significant contributions with my current programming skills.</p>
<h3> Plans for After Work</h3>
<p> MaoMao's husband cannot pick me up from work today, so I have to either walk home or take the public bus. The walk is about 40 minutes, and looked pretty long when MaoMao's husband drove me over in the morning. If it is not too hot, I would actually enjoy the exercise though. I also need to get the house keys from MaoMao before I leave work. I will have to find a place to eat dinner tonight by myself. More than anything else, I am learning to survive independently through this work experience. This is preparing me for college better than any other experience could. Overall, it is still pretty exciting to be adventuring myself in an unfamiliar city and blending in despite not being able to read most Chinese signs and menus. China has globalized so that there is PinYin and English everywhere, making my life much easier. </p>

<h1> Fourth Entry </h1>
<h2> Jason Lan, June 11, 2015. 13:00</h2>
<p> I have been so busy at work that I haven't had a chance to add a new entry. I created Entry 4 yesterday at 4 pm but didn't have a chance to add any content, so I just wrote the subtitles to help myself remember the events from the day before. I will run through everything that I experienced but in less detail unless I have more time to fill in what I missed.
<h3> Group Dinner</h3>
<p> My dinner plan was to go out on my own and try my luck against the vast unknown of Nanjing, but instead my company group had previously arranged a send off dinner for one of the group employees and invited me to come along. I joined them because it was easier than looking for dinner on my own and because the boss was treating us. We walked to the restuarant from the company, which was about a 2 km journey, and we chatted along the way. Everyone in the group is very friendly with each other, and to me, but I was most surprised at how tight the relationship between the group's workers and the boss was. The boss is a very open person, and loves to chat with others. He does a lot of the talking during lunchtimes conversations and his laugh is contagious. His voice is pretty high pitched for a man in his late 40s, and he is fun to listen to. He tries not to drink because he worries for his health, but ironically he smokes pretty often. Chinese people generally don't really care that smoking is bad for their health because it is part of their culture.</p>
<p> At dinner, there was a lot of spicy food (SiChuan or Hunan style) and the food was strangely salty instead of spicy. The KungPao Chicken was SiChuan style with peppercorns instead of sweet sauce. We spent about two hours working on dinner, and drank a lot of tea to counter the saltiness of the food. Hot water with few tea leaves is what Chinese people drink instead of cold water in the United States. The others also drank beer, which was not iced, as a counterpart to soft drinks in the US. They talked a lot about exotic foods and stories having to do with food which was difficult for me to understand since I am not clear on which type of food each district in China is known for and I am unfamiliar with many of the traditional Chinese foods.
<h3> Walking Home</h3>
<p> After dinner I had to find my own way home. Luckily, one of my coworkers lived in the same direction as me, so she walked with me part of the way until she had to go in a different direction. I might have been able to go from the office building to my home since I had carefully watched the road on the way to work in the morning, but I didn't really know where the restuarant was in relation to my home. Additionally, the streets look much different at nighttime, so I couldn't necessarily use the same landmarks I noticed in the morning to find my way back home. Using GaoDe map, I looked up the path to go home, so I at least would know which direction to go. Turns out, it was 3km away, which is pretty reasonable. After splitting up with my coworker, I only needed to walk in a straight line to get home. Still, when I walked to the gate of the community where the apartment was, it looked unfamiliar so I walked to the next gated community. Confused, I had to ask someone where the apartment building was. Finally, I got home safe and sound.</p>
<p> I was planning to contact MaoMao's husband, whose name I now know is Cheng Long, not to be confused with Jackie Chan's Chinese name Chen Long, but my phone was out of battery. I didn't use it at all but aparently it was draining battery rapidly and died before the end of the day. Cheng Long had planned to stay with his kid, but had to come to the apartment to check that I was ok.</p>
<h3> Going to work on my own </h3>
<p> The next morning Cheng Long didn't wake up by 8:40 and there was no food in the fridge so I went out on an adventure of my own. Looking for something familiar, I went to KFC which was also conviniently on my way to work. I bought a sandwich to go, since KFC only sells chicken sandwiches in China, and walked to work by myself. The trip took me about 30-40 minutes, not including the stop at KFC. I felt pretty accomplished getting to work by myself, but I should really try to get to work on time at 9 once rather than just making it before 10.</p>
<h3> Photoshop</h3>
<p> My boss, LaoZheng, told me I could try photoshop to format and arrange webpages. He got one of my coworkers to send me the photoshop file, which is in all probability a torrent file. He showed me how to do a couple of things: draw guide lines, slice, select and save slices, etc. Photoshop is surprisingly complex and has a lot of functions. I wasn't really sure what he wanted me to do with the website pictures, but it was a nice learning opportunity.</p>
<h3> Too Spicy</h3>
<p> At lunch I ordered spicy noodles, which was a big mistake. There were two options for the noodles: spiced (which normally means with spices and isn't necessarily) and spicy (DANGER!). I ordered the spiced noodles and couldn't finish them because after a couple bited my mouth started to go numb and then my whole body was kind of numb from the SiChuan spiciness. I bought a lemon tea drink, which was room temperature since Chinese people don't really drink cold drinks, but that didn't solve my problem. I had to order another nonspicy lunch instead. I can't even imagine eating the spicy type noodles. The biggest difference for me is that when something is spicy in the US, thers always cold water or soda to wash away the spiciness. Chinese people who eat spicy food eat it without water or even nonspicy foods to balance out the heat.</p>
<h3> Useful Work</h3>
<p>After lunch, I finally got my opportunity to do useful work. One worker contacted me through QQ and asked me to check their website for English errors and give suggestions on how to improve the website. This task made use of my native English skill and proofreading is something I have experience with because of essay writing. I looked through the various parts of the website and found that the English on the website is quite poor. The worker wasn't expecting nearly as many errors as I found. When I sent her the notepad file containing my corrections for the first fifth of the website that I looked through, she asked if that had all the corrections from the whole website. I replied that suggestions for the website would have to wait as I correct the grammar and spelling errors on the website. I think Chinese programmers or whoever is writing for the English website needs to use an English spellchecker at least to find the obvious errors before transfering the writing to code which has no built in spellcheck for text. In about 3 hours, I looked through the main parts of the website and found about 50 mistakes of various shapes and forms. I was happy to be doing something useful for the company instead of just freeloading and learning using their resources.</p>

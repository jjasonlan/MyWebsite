<h1> Thirteenth Entry</h1>

<h3> Last Day of the Internship </h3>
<p> This is possibly the last day of my internship because the rest of my group is going on a vacation trip to QingDao, which is an island with a nice beach or something. I can't come along because it's a three day trip and I'm leaving for Shanghai tomorrow so I can catch the flight to LA the day after. There will still be people in the office tomorrow but I will have to adapt to a new group which works in a different field than what I have been learning for the past three weeks, so I might go to ChengLong's company and work as a one day part time translator instead, since that would also be a worthwhile experience. Three weeks is a really short tenure but I am satisfied with my achievements as an intern. I didn't leave as large of an impact on the company as I had imagined, but I learned as much as I possibly could in three weeks and contributed to the company by helping out in some cases and doing major translation work for the company website. I was also able to understand some of the strengths and weaknesses of the company, which will allow me to make important changes to companies I work for in the future. </p>
<h3> Conclusion </h3>
<p> I think the way I approached learning as an intern was very effective, since I switched between many topics but stayed within my group's field of expertise so I could learn from the coworkers and get the most out of my short time in the company. Although the three weeks has gone by quickly, I also think that now is a good time for me to move on to something else. I have learned at the fastest pace possible for three weeks and I can feel that my learning pace is slowing down as content becomes more difficult to understand and I am beginning to delve more deeply into topics I have learned rather than broaden my scope of learning. Since a majority of my learning is still self-study and experimentation, it is useful for giving me an overview of various ideas and computer languages but is not effective for gaining credentials or becoming a working programmer. For more detailed learning I will need to go through college courses or more professional teaching. Perhaps the most important aspect of my self learning is to develop my personal interest in computer science and front end web development. </p>
<p> All in all, I have gotten the most out of these three weeks in Nanjing--from getting myself up in the morning to sleeping on time, from making myself breakfast to washing my own clothes, from buying train tickets to walking to work, from becoming friends with coworkers to playing ball with strangers, from reading Chinese to writing a website, and from learning to program to understanding Chinese traditions, I have gained experience that will help me through college and beyond, and all in a measly three weeks time. </p>

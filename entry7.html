<h3> Weekend in Nanjing</h3>
<h4> Saturday </h4>
<p> My grandparents, sister, and a close family friend we call 大妈妈 came to Nanjing from Shanghai this weekend. We traveled to many famous tourist attractions in Nanjing, including 夫子庙, 总统府, 玄武湖, 和 紫金山的中山陵. On Saturday morning I met up with them at Nanjing South Railway station, and we took the subway to Nanjing Railway station, where our hotel was located. I fell for a scam on the way to the hotel, since I had my guard down. An old lady asked me for money for a train ticket, saying she was 8 yuan short. I gave her a 10 when she clarified that she needed 28 yuan. I didn't have any small change left, so I asked her to wait a bit. Grandma came over and pulled me away, telling me that the lady was trying to cheat me. In hindsight, subway tickets only cost 2 yuan and there was no reason someone would ask me and not an older person for money unless they thought I was an easy target for a scam. Still, the 10 yuan taught me a lesson so I wasn't that upset. I know now that I need to be more careful in China than in the United States since there are a lot of cheaters, especially in busy places. </p>
<p> In the afternoon we went to ZiJin Mountain, but we were completely foreign to the area and had no clue how to get to the important places. Luckily, we met a tour guide who explained to us some things and offered to be our tour guide for 150 yuan. 大妈妈 wanted to walk away since a lot of scammers offer unfair prices and she didn't want to get ripped off. Grandpa made the decision to go with the tour guide since she seemed very knowledgable about the area. It turns out that she was a great tour guide and explained things to us which we would otherwise not have understood, like the historical references in the Ming Dynasty museum. She also knew the road very well, and took shortcuts that other tourists didn't know about. The mountain was very large, and walking between all the destinations she took us to would be near impossible. The highlight was ZhongShanLing, Sun YetSan's Mauloseum at the peak of the mountain. The view from the top of the over 300 stairs was incredible. The stairs were designed not to be visible from the top of the mountain, and all the buildings in Nanjing look like rectangles with equal shape and size from the mountaintop. The planning that went into the design of the city was unimaginable. </p>
<p> After exploring the ZiJin Mountain we went to Confucius' Temple, famous for its dragon boats and food. I bought some gifts for Mom there, all snacks from Nanjing. We took a shuttle tour but got off before it was over to buy things from the snack market and go to a restuarant. I had chicken blood soup, one of my favorite things to eat, but I accidentally added too much spice and had to add water to make it edible again. After dinner we made our way back to the hotel, and were pretty tired from all the traveling.</p>
<p> I stayed in the hotel with the rest of the family that night instead of going back to ChengLong's house. We split into two rooms, men in one and women in the other. I watched some TV before I went to sleep, and found out about a Chinese comedian who I really liked. We slept soon after getting to the hotel and prepared for another busy day. </p>
<h4> Sunday </h4>
<p> The next day we visited the Presidential Office, where General Jiang Jieshi worked. It was pretty bland for someone so famous, although the entire villa was large and Ming Dynasty style. We looked through many of the rooms but I couldn't understand a lot of the meaning because my knowledge of Chinese history is pretty minimal. Nanjing was the capital of the PRC before the communists took over China, so the history of the PRC leaders and battles is very important to the city. </p>
<p> The last place we visited was the XuanWu lake, which was very serene and cool during the killer heat that day. We rented a boat which we had to paddle ourselves which was tiring but fun. The boat couldn't go very fast, and would flow with the current of the water, so we couldn't go too far from the dock. The boat only held 4 people, so grandpa took a shuttle and visited all the islands in the lake. 大妈妈 and grandma complained that he didn't stay at the dock like he promised, and wouldn't let him live it down. It was all in good fun, and we went back to the hotel to grab our luggage at around 5pm. We had a lot of time before the train left at 7:50, so we took our time eating. I was pretty full after dinner and I tried to finish the sprite that I was drinking, which gave me a stomachache. The bubbles were stuck in my stomach making my stomach overfull. I almost threw up because of it. Grandpa tried to find a pharmacy to get me some stomach medicine, and we couldn't find one. I left better after a while and we went to the subway to get to the train station, but noticed that the station was 13 stops away. Even though we had so much time before, they ended up being late for their train and needed to wait for the next one. </p>
<p> I got off at RuanJian Blvd and walked back to ChengLong's house. I washed my clothes in the washer and went to sleep before 12, since I had to work the next day. The weekend was over and it was time to get back to work. </p>
